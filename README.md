## Yet Another Graphics Library

This is an archive from an old hobby project back in 2012-2013.

It's a nearly feature complete 2D game engin, based on OpenGL, GLFW and SOIL.

It is coded in C, and designed to be compiled as a DLL for use with any other language that can call C code.

The API is pretty straignt forward, and there is (complete?) documentation (in HTML format).

There are examples mainly in FreeBasic.
